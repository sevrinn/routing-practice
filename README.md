# Routing Practice

Create a simple react app that can handle these routes:

- home: should display a generic Welcome heading
- 4: should display number 4, or any other number sent through
- hello: should display the world hello or any other word sent through
  -hello/blue/red: should display the word 'hello' in blue text with a red background. It should work with any other valid word and colors
